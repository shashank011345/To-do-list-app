# To-do-list-app
This project involves designing and implementing a to-do list application that enables users to add, edit, and delete tasks. 
The application will include an intuitive interface with sections for inputting new tasks, displaying existing tasks with checkboxes to mark them as completed, and options to edit and delete tasks.
The functionality will be driven by JavaScript to ensure smooth and interactive task management.
